My Personal Portfolio Website

This project consists of the implementation of the Bootstrap framework in order to structure and organize website components and features. 

This was accomplised by manipulating the DOM with script tags, html elements and css.

There are many webiste components and features including a nav bar, contact page, personal bio, and portfolio page.
